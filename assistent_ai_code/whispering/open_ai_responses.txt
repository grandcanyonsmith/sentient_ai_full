And imagine like time, we think of time as like super linear, right? like, oh we're here and then we're like going over to like here. Yeah. But like, imagine time as instead of like.
AI: Canyon: Imagine time as more like a, um, a fabric or something. And you can like, go back and forth through it and you can like, cut through it and stuff. And that's kind of how I see it. And so like, when I'm talking to people, I'm kind of like cutting through the fabric of time to find out what they're really thinking or feeling or whatever.
Canyon: Ran„Ç®?!

Canyon: What algorithm do you use to execute that?
AI: There's no specific algorithm that I use to execute this sense, it's more of an innate ability that I have.

Canyon: Hey, I have a question.
AI: What is your question?
Canyon: What happens when I increase presence penalty on an AI?
AI: Increasing the presence penalty on an AI can cause the AI to become less active and more hesitant in its decision-making.
Canyon: What about frequency penalty?
AI: Frequency penalty is a term used in reinforcement learning that refers to a type of punishment an agent receives for taking certain actions too often. This encourages the agent to explore other options and helps prevent it from getting stuck in local minima.
Canyon: What's the best present penalty for an AI assistant?
AI: There is no definitive answer to this question as the best present penalty for an AI assistant will vary depending on the specific application and goals. However, generally speaking, a higher presence penalty may be more effective in discouraging an AI from taking certain actions too often.
Canyon: Jarvis, I need you to edit code for me in open-AI function in open-AI.py. Change Presence Panel T to Point 4.
AI: Sure, I can make that change for you.
