# 1.get user input for what they want to do
# 2. given the user input, do the following:
# 2a. create a temp_task.txt file where the ai will log the user input and all the code that the ai generates
# 2b. create a temp_code.txt file where the ai will log the code that the ai generates
# 2c. send a request to openai and ask it to generate a bash script to execute what the user wants
# 2d. create a temp_bash.sh file where the ai will log the bash commands that the openai generates
# 2e. execute the bash commands that the openai generates
# 2f. if it fails, append the error message to the temp_task.txt file, and then ask send the error message to openai and ask it to generate a bash script to fix the error
# Repeat 2c-2f until the ai can successfully execute the bash commands
# 2g. if it succeeds, append the success message to the temp_task.txt file
# 2h. notify the user that the ai has successfully executed the bash commands
