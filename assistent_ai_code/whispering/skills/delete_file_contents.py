# this program deletes the contents of a file or directory
# 1. it imports the module from read_file_contents.py to get the directory contents
# 2. it asks the user to enter the number of the file or directory they want to delete. It accepts only numbers, but it can accept multiple numbers separated by a space
# 3. it checks if the user input is a number
# 4. it checks if the number is in the range of the directory contents
# 5. it gets the file name
# 6. it checks if the file name is a file
# 7. it deletes the file
# 8. it checks if the file name is a directory
# 9. it deletes the directory
# 10. it asks the user if they want to delete another file or directory
# 11. it checks if the user input is y or n
